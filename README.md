# Sticky Note App

A modern, collaborative sticky note application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. This application allows teams to create, manage, and organize digital sticky notes with member-specific colors and priorities.

## Features

- Notes inherit active member's colors for visual organization

### Member System
- Add team members with customizable colors
- Member-specific note styling:
  - Header color
  - Body color (automatically lightened from header color)
  - Text color (#18181A)
- Visual member selection with active state:
  - White outline around active member's color
  - Click to select/deselect member
  - Error feedback when creating notes without active member
  - State managed locally in Controls component
  - Changes propagated to parent via callbacks
- Member attribution for notes
- Clean component hierarchy with proper prop passing
- Proper separation of member identity and note colors

### Modern UI/UX
- Responsive design
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Color palette selection
- Error handling with modal feedback:
  - Dark background (#35363e)
  - White text with medium weight
  - Consistent box shadow

  - Memoized click handlers
  - Better event propagation control
- State Management:
  - Efficient updates using functional setState
  - Proper cleanup of timeouts
  - Optimized localStorage interactions
- Code Splitting:
  - Lazy loaded modals using React.lazy
  - Modals only load when needed
  - Smaller initial bundle size
  - Proper Suspense boundaries
  - Centralized modal exports in modals/index.ts

### First-Time User Experience

When you first open the application, you'll see a welcome note with the following instructions:

```
Welcome to Sticky Notes! üìù

üéØ Quick Tips:

1. Add Team Members:
   ‚Ä¢ Click the "+" button
   ‚Ä¢ Enter their name and pick a color

2. Add a New Note:
   ‚Ä¢ Select a member color on the Control panel and click anywhere on the canvas

3. Filter Notes by Member:
   ‚Ä¢ Click a member's color
   ‚Ä¢ The notes will be filtered to show only notes assigned to that member
   ‚Ä¢ To remove the filter select the same member again

4. Assign Priority:
   ‚Ä¢ Click on the dot next to the Member name on the note
   ‚Ä¢ This will toggle between different Priority states

Try it out! Drag me around and create more notes!
```
